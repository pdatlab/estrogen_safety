## From FDA petition response ##

"The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary subtrial of WHI enrolled 2,947 hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age to evaluate the effects of daily oral 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens tablets compared to placebo on the incidence of probable dementia. After an average follow-up of 5 .2 years, an increased risk of developing probable dementia was seen in women treated with daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens relative to placebo (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.83-2.66).<sup>17</sup> Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and mixed types (having features of both AD and VaD). The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin subtrial enrolled 4,532 nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older to evaluate the effects of daily oral 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets compared to placebo on the incidence of probable dementia. After an average follow-up of 4 years, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women treated with daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate relative to placebo (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.21-3.48).<sup>18</sup>"
