**WORK IN PROGRESS - NEEDS REFS**
- $685 million to execute
- 40 sites

First study consisted of 3 parts

1. asdf
2. Women without a uterus (underwent a hysterectomy). These women experience hormone drops.

## Study 1  - Estrogen/Progesterone with uteruses ##
From JAMA 2002 paper:
- "**Objective:** To assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States."
- "**Design:** Estrogen plus progestin component of the Women’s Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16 608 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998.
- **Interventions:** Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n=8506) or placebo (n=8102).
- **Main Outcomes Measures** The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.
  - Risks (TODO: more, some may be benefits)
     - invasive breast cancer
     - stroke
     - Venous thromboembolic disease
  - Benefits
     - reduction in coronary heart disease



- Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary subtrial
  - 2,947 hysterectomized postmenopausal women
  - age 65 to 79
  - daily oral 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens tablets
  - TODO: Critical papers on this



## From FDA petition response ##

"The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary subtrial of WHI enrolled 2,947 hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age to evaluate the effects of daily oral 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens tablets compared to placebo on the incidence of probable dementia. After an average follow-up of 5 .2 years, an increased risk of developing probable dementia was seen in women treated with daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens relative to placebo (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.83-2.66).<sup>17</sup> Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and mixed types (having features of both AD and VaD). The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin subtrial enrolled 4,532 nonhysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older to evaluate the effects of daily oral 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets compared to placebo on the incidence of probable dementia. After an average follow-up of 4 years, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women treated with daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate relative to placebo (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.21-3.48).<sup>18</sup>"
